            <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.</li><br>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it is the next player's turn.</li><br>
            <li>The player can choose to 'hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it is the next player's turn.</li><br>
            <li>The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.</li><br>
